<div><b><em>The Begining of HTML Programing</em></b></div>

<br>

<div><b>HTML</b></div>

<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.  The web is made up of billions of HTML documents. Your computer submits a <em>HTTP</em> request to a server everytime you search for a webpage.  The server finds the document you are looking for and sends that document to your computers browser. The browser interprets the page and displays it on your computer.<br><br>
All HTML documents are made up of boxes.  These boxes can contain images, content and even other shapes.  Front-end web developers look at all websites as if they are laid out in boxes.  It can be useful to take something as simple as a pencil to scetch out these boxes.  To make these boxes, a "div" tag is used at the begining and end of each box.</P>

<div><b>Tags and Elements</b></div>

<p>Tags and elements make up every page of HTML code. This is how computers read the documents. Computers are stupid in that they can't catch basic coding mistakes that a human can catch. They simply do what they are told to do by the coding within the HTML document. Therefore, having a period out of place or forgetting to close a tag can cause major problems.</p>

<div><b>Inline or Block Elements</b></div>

<p>Elements of an HTML document are either Inline or Block. The only major difference we have discussed so far is that block elements are containe inside an "invisible box".</p>
